# Growtopia enet proxy
# Discord Server
(https://discord.gg/7TamzZ2rHs)
# NOTE: This is not an internal cheat. The internals which have popped up for sale are not internal cheats but proxies based on this one, don't fall for their scam

## How to use
* Does not need separate http server
* Use HxD or similar to edit "growtopia1.com" and "growtopia2.com" to "localhost" In growtopia binary.
* Alternative: Use hosts file to set growtopia1 and growtopia2 to point to 127.0.0.1 if you want to
* Start proxy -> Run localhost patched file (or normal with hosts) -> Works as supposed

## Features
* Print all variantlists and function calls
* Print all text packets

* Has a PoC OnSpawn modifier which appends netid to each players' name, and gives you unlim zoom
* Can both intercept outgoing and incoming packets
* Integrated http server
